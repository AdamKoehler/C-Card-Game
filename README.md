# C-Card-Game
Game I made for a Data Structures class
This game uses structs to define what a deck of cards is.
The struct is populated with 52 cards and the cards are passed to a shuffle function.
After shuffling the cards are placed on a stack just like at a casino table. No reaching in the middle. Only one point of access.
The program gets 5 cards and the user gets 5 cards. From there the game is scored and a winner is declared.
Good practice program to make for anyone wanting to learn structs and master pointers. The deck is changed alot and pointers are used to keep track of changes.
